# Modding with Magic: Custom Rare Mob

This is a video walkthrough for creating a fully functional custom rare mob from start to finish.

There are a small amount of function calls here that are not part of TSWoW, and neither is the "item generator" tool, but the majority of the video is still highly applicable for those who prefers to see others do modding to get a feel for how it works.
